# Complex Industry Translations

This repository contains the translation drafts for the complex industry plugin.

### Check this before submitting a translation
You should make sure you:
1. Change the id to something that isn't the default, or it will conflict with the default translations.
2. Change the * in the json to your language code or the translations will overwrite the default ones.
```jsonc
[
  {
    "id": "$industri_translation00", // <-- change this id as well to something like $industri_translation_nl00
    "type": "translation",
    "*": { //  <-- change this to the language code for your language
      // cool translations going on here
    }
  }
]
```
